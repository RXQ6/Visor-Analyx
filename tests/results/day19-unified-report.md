## Current Risks

- P1 legacy cases do not expose complete traces; process metrics remain unavailable for those cases.
- Workflow routes are covered by evaluator tests but are not yet a formal suite in the unified run.
- Token usage is unavailable until the underlying model clients expose it.
- Latency is environment-sensitive; the gate uses a versioned baseline plus explicit tolerance while retaining legacy hard limits.
